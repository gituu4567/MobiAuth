# MobiAuth
OAuth despite its advantages failed to prevent several breaches and brute force attacks that can and have broken the schema. MobiAuth proposes the utilization of fingerprint scanners available in mobile phones to locally authorize the user and send the imei number available locally in the phone to the resource owner to authenticate and authorize the user. In turn the client application will receive tokens generated and based on which the client application can authenticate the user.
